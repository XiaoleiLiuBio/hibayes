Description: 'hibayes' is an user-friendly R package to fit 3 types of bayesian model using individual-level, summary-level, and individual plus pedigree-level (single-step) data for both Genomic prediction/selection (GS) and Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), it was desighed to estimate joint effects and genetic parameters for a complex trait, including:
    (1) fixed effects and coefficients of covariates,
    (2) environmental random effects, and its corresponding variance, 
    (3) genetic variance, 
    (4) residual variance, 
    (5) heritability, 
    (6) genomic estimated breeding values for both genotyped and non-genotyped individuals,
    (7) SNP effect size, 
    (8) phenotype/genetic variance explained (PVE) for single or multiple SNPs, 
    (9) posterior probability of association of the genomic window (WPPA), 
    (10) posterior inclusive probability (PIP). 
    The functions are not limited, we will keep on going in enriching 'hibayes' with more features.
